These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The overall result of all classifiers shows that the tree classifiers (RandomForest and ADTree) obtained the best performance compared to meta-classifiers (Decorate and AdaBoost.M1). RandomForest is the best classifier with recall of 0.971, precision of 0.977, F- measure of 0.974, accuracy of 0.972, and lowest false positive rate of 0.87.\n","\n","- XSSClassifier: An Efficient XSS Attack Detection Approach Based on Machine Learning Classifier on SNSs\n","Shailendra Rathore*, Pradip Kumar Sharma*, and Jong Hyuk Park*\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S0HJNTDCxZrT"},"source":["### Classification Report"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"aZWWXHgLxZrT","outputId":"373b406a-617a-43c4-a81c-3e40b2e0ba15"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Classification Report #6 MLPClassifier\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       1.00      1.00      1.00     13437\n","           1       0.99      1.00      1.00     11594\n","\n","    accuracy                           1.00     25031\n","   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00     25031\n","weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00     25031\n","\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","\n","print(\"Classification Report #6 MLPClassifier\")\n","\n","print(classification_report(y_test, predictions6))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ImSQ5gCdxZrT"},"source":["### Confusion Matrix\n","![cm.png](attachment:cm.png)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jg6Mtd8QxZrU","outputId":"5f17c974-b15a-4ad2-eb17-7e45deadf255"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","Confusion Matrix #6 MLPClassifier\n","[[13377    60]\n"," [   45 11549]]\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","\n","print(\"\\nConfusion Matrix #6 MLPClassifier\")\n","\n","\n","print(confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions6))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Wz2xcrzJxZrU"},"source":["## 5 .
